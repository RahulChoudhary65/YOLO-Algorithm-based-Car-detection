# YOLO-Algorithm-based-Car-detection
Based on the YOLO Algorithm method need to detect the cars from a image and enclosed them into boxes and need to make predictions. Also using sliding window we made lots of boxes that encloses the some part of car area . To remove them we use IoU and some probability bound.

Due to Large size of zip file(file folder) unable to upload the whole Folder. But No need to worry I wanna to provide the google drive link of the Folder. I hope this will help :)
